# YEA, I KNOW NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE
- This is just a fun project for me to gauge my level of programming, and isn't in anyway a good piece of software!! It just works (I think).

- The project depends on libcsv (rgamble/libcsv), which is an excellent API btw!

- Curious nerds can just see the code, it isn't rocket science.

# Improvements
 - The excecutable expects the todo.csv file to be in the same folder as executable.
 - A config to set the colors
